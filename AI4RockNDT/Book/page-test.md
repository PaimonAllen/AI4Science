# Page Test

## Pages

Add pages, groups, external links, and more to your GitBook spacesA page in GitBook is the place where you add, edit and embed content. Pages always live inside a [space](https://docs.gitbook.com/content-editor/editor/content-structure/what-is-a-space), allowing you to group up related content and create different sections for the topics or areas you’re covering.

#### Table of contents <a href="#table-of-contents" id="table-of-contents"></a>

You can create as many pages as you need in a space. They’re all visible on the left side of your screen in your space’s [table of contents](https://docs.gitbook.com/content-editor/editor/navigation#table-of-contents).

#### Organizing your content <a href="#organizing-your-content" id="organizing-your-content"></a>

There are three types of pages you can add:

**Pages**

A page has a title, and optional description, and an area where you can write and add any kind of content.‌You can nest pages by dragging and dropping a page below an other in the table of contents. Doing this creates a subpage.**Tip:** There’s no limit to page nesting, but we’d recommend you avoid more than three levels of nesting to avoid an overly-complex navigation.When you change the title of a page, the page’s slug (the part at the very end of the URL, e.g. `/hello-world`) will also change — unless you’ve manually set the page’s slug previously.You can change the title and the slug of a page at any time by clicking opening the page’s Action menu![Three vertical dots](https://2775338190-files.gitbook.io/\~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FIfd7ka3cralqGUz0Z41B%2FFrame%201.png?alt=media\&token=2cddf304-8c59-4623-b7c2-78b494275308)and choosing **Rename**.

**Page groups**

Page groups make it easy to bring pages together into sections that cover related content.Page groups can only live at the **top level** of the [table of contents](https://docs.gitbook.com/content-editor/editor/navigation#table-of-contents). You cannot nest page groups inside page groups.To change the title and slug of a page group, click the Actions menu icon![Three vertical dots](https://2775338190-files.gitbook.io/\~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FNkEGS7hzeqa35sMXQZ4X%2Fuploads%2FIfd7ka3cralqGUz0Z41B%2FFrame%201.png?alt=media\&token=2cddf304-8c59-4623-b7c2-78b494275308)next to the group title in the table of contents and choose **Rename**.

**External links**

External links are simply links to external sites and resources. Adding a link doesn’t create a page in your content. Clicking one in the sidebar will immediately open the link in a new tab.

#### Create a new page <a href="#create-a-new-page" id="create-a-new-page"></a>

#### Create a page group <a href="#create-a-page-group" id="create-a-page-group"></a>

Just like creating a new page, you can create a page group by choosing **New page** > **New group** from the bottom of your table of contents.

## Create an external link <a href="#external-links-1" id="external-links-1"></a>

To add an external link to your space, click the **New page** button at the bottom of the table of contents, then choose **New link**. Give the link a title — this will appear in the table of contents — and then add the URL and click **Insert**.

#### Can’t see the option to create a new page? <a href="#cant-see-the-option-to-create-a-new-page" id="cant-see-the-option-to-create-a-new-page"></a>
